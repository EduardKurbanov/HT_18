How come even my pocket supercomputer with 8 cores and 8GB RAM takes that much time to display just some text and pictures?<p>It&#x27;s yet worse with reddit.<p>I do understand that some companies may be motivated to break their own websites to force users to install spyware (&quot;it&#x27;s better in the app!&quot;), but making a broken website doesn&#x27;t take dozens of megabytes of JS. Same slowness could be achieved with a few setTimeout()s. What&#x27;s more, websites are slow even when they aren&#x27;t trying to push an app down your throat - e.g. the desktop versions of those same websites are hardly better, and even websites that don&#x27;t have an app to &quot;offer&quot; are oftentimes just as overengeneered.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to understand is what is the motivation behind this? I wouldn&#x27;t have any questions if webpages required manpower and optimizations to be fast - but on the contrary, anyone with most basic html skills can come up with a faster frontend than twitter&#x27;s[1] AND cover that same functionality (text, a few images and a couple of forms - ALL of this is covered by HTML alone, doesn&#x27;t even need a single line of JS!). This means that companies pay people to make their websites worse, and to do that in a laborious manner - again, not just some setTimeouts()s, but dozens of megabytes of code (and that&#x27;s compressed!). And I can&#x27;t help but wonder - what is the incentive for that? Why? A business should generally save money wherever possible and only spend it to make profits, shouldn&#x27;t it? I just can&#x27;t see how the crime against everything decent that is the twitter frontend could possibly benefit the company, or anyone for that matter. If anything it would harm it. And it costs it money.<p>[1] - see e.g. Nitter, Invidious, Teddit - all of those much more robust than the sites they grab data from.

The site is just a signup, but later this week it’ll be on the App Store. The first part of this post is essentially a TLDR. The second part is the story behind it, if you like lifehacking.<p>1. TLDR - What it is, why I made it, and what is solves:<p>The tool pairs you with an assistant who will help you tailor your routines and habits around whatever you’re throwing at your schedule each hour. (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.athios.co)<p>I made this because I’m a student at university and it’s incredibly hard to make progress using the well known habit-tracking and routine building approaches advocated by most lifehacker books and blogs. It’s just very difficult to have fun and do interesting new things when you have to make everything in your life routine-based to progress on your goals. I hope this is useful to you.<p>2. The story behind the tool, if you&#x27;re interested:<p>When I was a junior in high school my dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, and as he lost his job, slowly but consistently many parts of my family’s life deteriorated since he was the only breadwinner of the family. By Senior year my mom was asking for donations on I-45 in Houston while I was at school. I had slept through most of high school, so community college was in my cards. I turned to lifehacking to get to the university of my dreams.<p>2 years later when I finally got to the university I wanted to go: Everything fell apart. I stopped showing up to class. I slept all day. I over ate. I gained 30 pounds. I failed all my classes, and had a 1.8 GPA. I ended up using an app called Fabulous, it was a little expensive, but it really got my crap together. In about 4 months I went from ~245 lbs to ~215. I had never once in my life considered implementing a morning or evening routine, and it worked. I was rocking all A’s, and then a month later, the pandemic hit. I was still keeping my routines, and losing weight because of the looming threat of being expelled from the university, but by January 2021… I was done with this crap.<p>I had heard of Future (a personal training app - it’s expensive) and I used it, while having my mother (reluctantly) look at my progress on my daily routines (from Fabulous) through a cheap little system I put together. Yes, because of Future, this was a very expensive experiment, but I wanted to lose a lot of weight and break into Software Engineering as a non-CS major. The results were pretty good. I went from ~215 lbs to 190 lbs in about 5-6 months, and got some internship offers, and kept progressing in my major at school. I think this worked because you always know someone is gonna see if you did it or not. From my findings, it certainly helps to use accountability in conjunction with routines and consistency, but the system for sure keeps you powering through changes, and since students are constantly moving apartments, cities, sleeping in, and procrastinating, this helped.<p>Last semester, some friends wanted help with routines, so I started making a tool (on TestFlight) where I was the “coach” and I would create mixtures of the many methods learned from books, and apps I’ve tried. My goal was to help keep their streak going as long as possible. And if they broke it, my main priority was making sure they could restart it ASAP. The main thing that helped them was not just that they knew I’d see their routines, but that they could also talk to me about their routines. The friends I helped ended up sticking with it daily for 4 months (the entire semester). We’ve paused briefly since I’m making this into an app that’ll get into the app store.",1643180288,Lifehacking: Maintaining routines throughout uncontrollable schedules,story,

Not a terrible idea, but I don&#x27;t want to sink 3 months into something only to have to return to school. Also negates mentorship.

I have been publishing first author papers at a rate of about 2 per year. I am particularly good at using ideas from one field to solve problems in another, which is why changing fields each postdoc has been a path of least resistance.<p>Recently, I have solved a problem which feels significantly more important than what I have done in the past. It is one of those instances where you can use auto differentiation infrastructure to solve a problem which doesn&#x27;t really look like machine learning. People in my lab are excited about it, but there does not seem to be any way for me to leverage this excitement into any sort of long term contract. All that is on offer is that the lab PIs want to write a proposal, which doesn&#x27;t even mention my name, and then if that proposal gets funded, they will rehire me to work on the project (although, there are no guarantees that they will not hire someone else instead, which is a serious concern when multiple PIs are competing to hire someone). As a result of my field hopping, trying to become a PI myself isn&#x27;t really an option.<p>Is there any mechanism for applying for private sector research jobs where I can bring a project with a prototype along and be like &quot;let me develop this for you, and you can hire me as an employee&quot;, kind of like a proposal &#x2F; job application combination?
